# POST-XSS-Exploit
This can be used to exploit POST XSS without much interaction from the victim.

## How to exploit?
Upload the 5 files to your hosting by typing the URL of your website instead of `attacker.com`.
Replace `vulnerablesite.com` with the vulnerable site on your target.
Replace the form variables below with the variables of the form that contain the XSS vulnerability.
In addition, you may need to change payload to bypass existing security filters.
